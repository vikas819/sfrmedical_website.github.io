The process is reasonably straightforward: the force signs a contract with SoftCat (our lead contractor) via the NHS SBS framework, who then awards the work to us. We send monthly invoices to SoftCat, who passes them along to the force, who then pays SoftCat, and SoftCat pays us. Nothing changes for execution â€“ the OICs interface with our CRMs, and our team provides insights on the monthly KPIs.<br/><br/>The Service Level Agreement (SLA) National Rate Card and the Framework Terms and Conditions (T&C) can be downloaded from Blue Light Procurement Database (BLPD).

Once we reach an agreement on the terms, including a go-live date, we get everything in place to support the rollout on day one.</li>
