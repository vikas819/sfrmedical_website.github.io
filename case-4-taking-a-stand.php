                            	<p>SFR Medical was founded on the principle of ensuring justice for all, and this mission drives everything we do.</p>

                                <p>Our position is simple:</p>

                                <ul class="list clearfix mb_20">
                                    <li class="p_relative d_block fs_16 lh_22 fw_normal pl_20 mb_10">We stand against racial injustice and failures of criminal justice, regardless of who the victim is, where they are from, what their profession is, or the color of their skin</li>
                                    <li class="p_relative d_block fs_16 lh_22 fw_normal pl_20 mb_10">We believe in peaceful protests for positive change, a change that can reshape the world we live in for the better</li>
                                    <li class="p_relative d_block fs_16 lh_22 fw_normal pl_20 mb_10">We support our black colleagues, partners, clients, and friends</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Silence is no longer acceptable.</p>

                                <p>We promise to keep working and learning. We pledge to include discussions about inequality when thinking about how we, as a business and as individuals, spend time and money, and allocate resources.</p>

                                <p>But we can’t do this alone – we need to work together to make meaningful change not only happen but stick.</p>

                                <p>So let’s keep working. Let’s stand for justice. Let’s stand together and say it loud and clear: #BlackLivesMatter #WeStandforJustice</p>

                                <p>
                                    Today, we’re taking our first step to show our support. We are proud to announce that through the end of 2020, we will not charge for any medical evidence report where the victim works in the healthcare or criminal justice
                                    fields so that our public servants can in turn get back to their jobs helping victims. We feel this is a small but important step to take as a reflection of our commitment to helping all victims get justice, and in honor of our
                                    partnerships.
                                </p>

                                <p>If you are looking for some causes to support that protect black lives and victims of injustice, here are a few we suggest looking into:</p>
