                            	<p>The impact of pagination software for solicitors in the UK is significant. It has revolutionised the way legal documents are prepared, managed and presented, making the process faster, more accurate and more efficient.</p>

                                <p>Pagination software is a tool or software application that automatically adds page numbers to a document. It is commonly used in the legal industry to number pages in legal documents and bundles. It can be a standalone software application, or can be integrated into other software programs such as document management systems.</p>

                                <p>It works by analyzing the document and inserting page numbers at specific intervals or based on specific criteria. The software can also handle complex pagination requirements such as different numbering sequences for different sections of a document, or the exclusion of certain pages from pagination.</p>

                                <p>Some pagination software also includes features such as Bates numbering, which is a system used to uniquely identify legal documents, and automated formatting options to ensure that documents are consistently formatted throughout.</p>

                                <p>Using pagination software can significantly speed up the process of numbering pages in a document and ensure that page numbers are accurate and consistent. It is particularly useful for large documents or bundles that would otherwise require manual page numbering, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
